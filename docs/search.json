    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis book provides a visual story of the code used to support Baldock et al., “Headwater streamflow variability is amplified by drought”, part of the USGS Eco-Drought Project administered by the USGS Ecosystems Mission Area and Water Mission Area.\nProject team: Jeff Baldock, Jenn Fair, Ben Letcher, Robert Al-Chokhachy, Jason Dunham, and Clint Muhlfeld.\nSignificance: Headwater streams account for a majority of river networks worldwide and have a disproportionately large influence on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Headwater streams also support critical habitat for many species, including cold-water fishes, many of which are declining or at risk of extinction.\nProblem: Headwater streams are vastly underrepresented in streamflow monitoring networks, which place greater emphasis on mainstem rivers. As a result, less is known about how headwaters respond to changing water availability. Headwater streams therefore represent a blind spot in understanding flow regime variability and for assessing ecosystem vulnerability to changing climatic conditions, including increases in the frequency and severity of drought.\nQuestions:\n\nHow do streamflow regimes vary spatially in headwater stream networks?\nHow does this spatial variability change among years with climatic conditions indicative of drought?\nWhat is the value of reference gages for understanding drought-driven low flow conditions in headwaters?\n\n\nThis information is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision.
