**Purpose:** Evaluate spatiotemporal variation in drought-related low flow conditions across headwater stream networks. 

**Approach:**

* Derive reference ("fixed" thresholds from reference/Big G gages) and site-specific low flow thresholds from contemporary data (*sensu* Hammond *et al.* 2022). 
* Use heatmaps to show how the duration and severity of low flow conditions varies among headwater locations and relative to big G.
* Use scatterplots to quantify the effect of regional water availability on spatial heterogeneity in drought-related low flow conditions. 
* Explore how the effect size changes depending on the magnitude of the low flow threshold used.

## Low flow thresholds

### Basin scale

Generate fixed and time varying (by day of year) drought/low flow thresholds from long-term (1970-2025) big G streamflow data. Quantiles in ~0.05 increments from 0.02 to 0.50.

### Site specific

Drought/low flow delineation is somewhat complicated by the fact that some streams simply have greater yield than others. For example, at groundwater-dominated sites, the above approach will never detect low flow conditions based on big G thresholds, but this doesn't mean that flow at that site isn't lower than normal (for that site). This is most obvious in the Snake River basin, where NF Spread Creek Upper never experiences drought (because this is presumably a gaining reach) and Rock and Grouse Creeks are in a perpetual state of drought (presumable these are losing reaches). This is a classic "At which level of organization do I standardize my data?" question: are general differences in flow volume among sites signal or noise? But perhaps more importantly, this is a question of "what is drought?" Is drought relative to some larger regional metric (e.g., big G)? Or is it a local phenomenon, where the specifics of individual streams and reaches matter. 

For each site individually, generate (fixed) drought/low flow thresholds using the same quantiles same as above: ~0.05 increments from 0.02 to 0.50. Restrict data to selected basins, sites, and years with (nearly) complete summer (July, August, September) data over the selected periods/locations. (Standardization needs to be done over comparable time periods, at least among sites within basins). 

Require 95% data availability across all water years for site to be included!

Organize data, get site-level low flow threshold values, and denote drought periods

#### Duration

Show proportion of days (July - September) below different low flow thresholds (derived from long-term Big G data) for each site during a relatively wet year and a dry year. Then, for each year, plot the relationship between the among site (little g's only) standard deviation of low flow duration and the low flow threshold used to calculate duration

#### Duration

Show proportion of days (July - September) below different low flow thresholds (derived from temporally restricted, site-specific data) for each site during a relatively wet year and a dry year. Then, for each year, plot the relationship between the among site (little g's only) standard deviation of low flow duration and the low flow threshold used to calculate duration

### Summary plots

What is the relationship between regional water availability (total summer flow percentile from long-term big G flow data) and spatial variation in little g drought duration and deficit?

Hypothesis: spatial variation in drought duration and deficit increases in dry years as controls on little G streamflow shift from regional to local (catchment) scales. (This follows directly from objective 1, but specifically considers low flow conditions).

#### Fixed threshold

First, using drought as defined from fixed thresholds (low flow thresholds derived from long-term big G records are applied to each little G)

## Model drought agreement

How suitable are reference gages for predicting low flow conditions in headwater stream networks? 

* Calculate the difference between low flow duration at little g's versus that at big G and model the relationship between these differences and basin-specific annual water availability to understand how reference gage suitability may change with regional climatic context
* Include effects of water availability on the regression uncertainty (sigma) to evaluate how spatial heterogeneity in low flow conditions changes with regional water availability. 
  + Calculate attenuation strength (the ratio between model standard deviation in dry versus wet years, sensu Chezik *et al.* 2017) to describe the degree to which spatial variation in low flow conditions changes with annual water availability
* Include random effects for basin to account for basin-level differences in the primary (and sigma?) relationship
* Iteratively fit the model to data derived from a range of critical low flow thresholds to evaluate how the definition of low flows/drought affects inferences


### Data manipulation and plots

### Simple 

#### Specify and fit JAGS models

Specify ~simple JAGS model: linear regression between regional water availability and low flow duration, where sigma is modeled as a function of regional water availability. 

This is the form we used originally, pooling data across basins to estimate a common relationship. Howeer, this is overly simplified, as it fails to account for basin-level groupings in the data
```{r}
cat("model {

for (i in 1:nObs) {

  D[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], pow(sigma[i], -2))
  mu[i] <- alpha + beta * W[i]
  log(sigma[i]) <- sig.alpha + sig.beta * W[i]
  
  # Log-likelihood
  loglik[i] <- logdensity.norm(D[i], mu[i], pow(sigma[i], -2))
  }


##--- PRIORS --------------------------------------------------------##

alpha ~ dnorm(0, pow(10, -2))

### Random effects

#### Specify and fit JAGS models

Add basin-level random effect to the intercept and slope of the primary relationship. Random effects on the mean, but not the variance, strike a reasonable balance between accounting for basin-level differences, while not overstepping the limits of the data. Per discussion with Ben Augustine (USGS NOROCK/EESC), it is generally rare to put random effects on variances; not because it doesn't work conceptually, but because variances require much more data to estimate well relative to means

### Full random effects

#### Specify and fit JAGS models

Add random effect of basin to the variance regression. Per discussion with Ben Augustine (USGS NOROCK/EESC), it is generally rare to put random effects on variances; not because it doesn't work conceptually, but because variances require much more data to estimate well relative to means. Indeed, for any given basin, we have relatively few observations and (perhaps more importantly) the coverage of data over the x-variable (water availability) is ~poor. This leads to poorly defined global parameters that differ from what logically makes sense and what is suggested when all the data is viewed together. Furthermore, the basin-level regression fits deviate considerably from expectations because there are few data to actually inform these relationship. See model outputs below (fit to 15% threshold only)

## Model

Here I tried to model drought duration using a hierarchical binomial model, then estimate the effect of regional water availability on spatial variation drought duration within headwater basins. But most of the parameters do not converge (most notable, the spatial variation parameter), which is probably a result of so few data points (years) per basin.
