Headwater streams also support critical habitat for many species, including cold-water fishes, many of which are declining or at risk of extinction. \n\n**Problem:** Headwater streams are vastly underrepresented in streamflow monitoring networks, which place greater emphasis on mainstem rivers. As a result, less is known about how headwaters respond to changing water availability. Headwater streams therefore represent a blind spot in understanding flow regime variability and for assessing ecosystem vulnerability to changing climatic conditions, including increases in the frequency and severity of drought.\n\n**Questions:** \n\n1. How do streamflow regimes vary spatially in headwater stream networks?\n2. How does this spatial variability change among years with climatic conditions indicative of drought?\n3. What is the value of reference gages for understanding drought-driven low flow conditions in headwaters?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*This information is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision.
