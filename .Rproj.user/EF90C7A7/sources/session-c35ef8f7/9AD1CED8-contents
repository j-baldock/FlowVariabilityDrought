# FlowVariabilityDrought
Code to support Baldock et al., "Headwater streamflow variability is amplified by drought". This repository is a subset of EcoDrought-Analysis (https://github.com/j-baldock/EcoDrought-Analysis), in which the code in the current repo was originally developed. This repo provides more streamlined versions of the original code, focused on the analyses used in the manuscript. Our goals are to (1) quantify how flow regimes vary within and among headwater stream networks and relative to long-term USGS reference gages located on larger rivers, (2) assess how spatial streamflow heterogeneity within networks changes with interannual variation in drought intensity, and (3) explore the suitability of reference gages for characterizung drought conditions upstream.
